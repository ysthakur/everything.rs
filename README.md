Do you ever feel like washing your hands after a coding session, disgusted at having to use essential
Unix utilities with not the tiniest bit of Rust in them? If so, this project is for you! If not, this project is
still for you, you just haven't seen the light yet. Head on over to [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
to meet your salvation.

Perhaps you've been using one of those "X Unix tool, but in Rust" things popping up everywhere. But that's
not sustainable or convenient, because porting individual tools to Rust is slow, difficult work, and these individual
ports often differ in behavior from the tool they were meant to replace. Most Unix tools don't have Rust ports,
and many of these ports require maintenance. This repository aims to fix that.

Behold, a port of **everything** to Rust.

Want a drop-in Rust-powered replacement for `ls` or `echo`? `everything.rs` has got you covered.
Now you can list directories, print strings, and more blazing fast ðŸš€, without the guilt of using a
non-Rust tool! Rest assured, `everything.rs` will have the *exact* same behavior as `ls` or `echo`, but with Rust ðŸ¦€.

## Installation

Download an executable from [the latest release](https://github.com/ysthakur/everything.rs/releases/latest), or,
if you want hemorrhaging-edge eveningly pre-pre-releases, download the artifact from the latest green run
[here](https://github.com/ysthakur/everything.rs/actions/workflows/build.yml).

Put it in a folder that's in your `PATH`, rename it to `everything`, and you're good to go!

`everything` is also available on crates.io as the [`everything2`](https://crates.io/crates/everything2) crate.

`everything.rs` proudly uses [ZeroVer](https://0ver.org/) instead of the extremely overrated SemVer.
See the link for more information on how `everything`'s versioning works.

## Usage

To use a Rusty version of `ls`, use
```bash
everything ls
everything ls -al # You can pass arguments too
```

You can use aliases to make it more convenient. For example, `alias ls=everything ls` will let you use
`ls -al` instead of typing out `everything ls -al`.

## FAQ

### How does it work?

`everything.rs` applies the cutting-edge technology pioneered by [`exec-rs`](https://github.com/faradayio/exec-rs)
to perfectly emulate any program. `everything.rs` does require you to have the program installed on your
machine so it can better emulate it.

### Does it work for more than Unix tools?

Of course! Want a Rust-powered replacement for that sluggish bash script you made? No problem,
just stick an `everything` in front of it and use it the same way you normally would (`everything <script path> <args...>`).

### There's no way you've ported *everything*. Does it actually work?

You better believe it.

### What platforms does `everything.rs` support?

It should work on any OS from the Unix family, including, unfortunately, MacOS. If you're on Windows, I'd suggest either switching
to Linux or defenestrating yourself.

### I love it! How can I support this project?

Despite how useful this software is, I don't want any compensation for it - working on this was fun enough!
