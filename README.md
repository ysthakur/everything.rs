# everything.rs

You may have noticed a bunch of Rust ports of Unix tools popping up everywhere.
Porting individual tools to Rust is slow, difficult work, however. This repository aims
to fix that. Behold, a port of **everything** to Rust.

Want a drop-in Rust-powered replacement for `ls` or `echo`? `everything.rs` has got you
covered. Now you can list directories and print strings blazing fast ðŸš€, without the guilt of using a
non-Rust tool.

Want a Rust-powered replacement for that sluggish Python script you made? No problem, `everything.rs`
has got you covered there, too.

## Installation

Download the artifact from the latest green run [here](https://github.com/ysthakur/everything.rs/actions/workflows/build.yml).

## Usage

Put the `everything` executable anywhere you want (e.g. `$HOME`)

Make a symlink with the name of the tool you want to Rust-ify to the `everything` executable
and put the symlink in a folder that's included in your `$PATH`. Make sure you don't overwrite
the original executable, because `everything.rs` needs it to be able to emulate it.

```bash
ln -s $HOME/everything $HOME/bin/ls
```

## FAQ

### How does it work?

`everything.rs` applies the cutting-edge technology pioneered by [`exec-rs`](https://github.com/faradayio/exec-rs)
to perfectly emulate any program. `everything.rs` does require you to have the program installed on your
machine so it can better emulate it.

### There's no way you've ported *everything*. Does it actually work?

You better believe it.

### I love it! When will it have Windows support?

Working on it.

### How can I support this project?

Despite how valuable this software is to all of humanity, I do not seek any compensation for my work.
Knowing that I have benefitted the world is enough payment.
